I'm a third-year Ph.D. student, advised by [Dr. Julie Kientz][julie], in the department of [Human Centered Design & Engineering][hcde] at the [University of Washington][uw]. My research focuses on using AI and machine learning to develop accessible learning technologies for children with speech and language difficulties. I'm also passionate about helping children build AI literacy competencies so they can understand and interact with AI in thoughtful, informed ways.

Previously, I worked as a middle school Computer Science teacher at [Ridgefield Academy][ridgefield]. I also served as a research assistant at Utah State University with [Dr. Kristen Searle][kristen], contributing to projects that integrated electronic textiles into computer science education.

I received my BA from [Swarthmore College][swarthmore], with a double major in Computer Science and Studio Arts. During my time at Swarthmore, I founded [Nepali Girls Code][lang], an initiative that provides culturally responsive computer science education to middle school girls in Nepal. I interned at [Autodesk][autodesk], and I am a [CERES scholar][ceres] with the Jacobs Foundation.

I‚Äôm always open to collaborations and conversations. Please feel free to reach out!
